# hello-world
Learning me some GitHub!

I'm learning to code in C, and ARM assembly (focusing particularly on the feature set found within the Cortex A9, which is found in the Vita)

I'd really like to code a TMAPI-like plugin for the Vita as well as an RTM menu for KZM.

Long-term, I would like to add a new waepon-type (or edit an existing one) in KZM for fun and profit. :P

I also hope to contribute dumping and reversing the Kernel exports in the Vita once I've got my footing.
